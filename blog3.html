             This photo captures an important moment from our thesis defense for the "ESALE SYSTEM: Computerized Inventory, Transactions, and Sales System for J EM Minimart." The project was designed to automate the processes at J EM Minimart, including inventory management, transaction tracking, and sales monitoring. By creating a streamlined system, we aimed to reduce human errors, improve the accuracy of sales and inventory data, and help the business operate more efficiently.

            In our defense, we presented the system's design principles, the challenges we faced during development, and the key features that make it stand out. These features include real-time inventory tracking, user-friendly interfaces for both sales transactions and inventory management, and detailed reporting tools for better business analysis. Our system also integrates advanced database management techniques to ensure seamless performance.

            This defense was the culmination of months of hard work, research, and collaboration, and it was a valuable experience that allowed us to demonstrate our technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of the real-world impact of technology in business.
